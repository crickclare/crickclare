Recently, after the <strong>Big Bash League (BBL)</strong>, he left Perth Scorchers and joined Melbourne Renegades. </p> <p> He last played for Australia in a T20 match a year ago and in the One-Day format nearly three years ago. Additionally, he has not played for Western Australia since September last year and has decided not to take a state contract for the 2024-25 season. </p> <p> Reflecting on his journey, Behrendorff recalled moving to Western Australia as a 19-year-old. He stated that now is the right time for him to enter the next phase of his career, though he still has a lot of cricket left in him. </p> <p> <strong> \"I have lived my childhood dream by playing state cricket and then representing Australia as well. WACA (Western Australian Cricket Association) has been my home. I have spent my entire adult life here.\" </strong> Behrendorff told <strong>cricket.com.au</strong>. </p> <p> <strong> \"When I first arrived here, I was 19, and now I am almost 35. I have had many amazing moments here. Now, I am moving in a slightly different direction, but that does not mean my cricket career is over. I still have a lot of cricket left in me, but from Western Australia's perspective, it is time to move forward.\" </strong> </p> <p> Having played in various T20 leagues, Behrendorff recently featured for <strong>Pretoria Capitals</strong> in the <a href= \"https://www.crickclare.com/tag/sa20-2025\"><strong>SA20 2025</strong></a>. He could now become one of the most sought-after fast bowlers in franchise leagues worldwide. </p> <p> Behrendorff represented <a href=\"https://www.crickclare.com/tag/mumbai-indians\"><strong>Mumbai Indians (MI)</strong></a> in the IPL in 2019 and 2023, taking <strong>19 wickets in 17 matches</strong>. However, he went unsold in last year's mega auction. Despite this, he could be a valuable replacement option for teams in case of injuries in the upcoming seasons <a href=\"https://www.crickclare.com/tag/ipl-2025\"><strong>IPL 2025</strong></a>. </p></div>",
